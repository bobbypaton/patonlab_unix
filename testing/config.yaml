# Computational Chemistry Software Test Suite Configuration
#
# This file allows you to customize executable paths and test settings
# without modifying the Python script.
#
# To use: Place this file in the same directory as autotest.py,
# or specify with: autotest.py --config /path/to/config.yaml

# Global settings
settings:
  # Number of cores for parallel tests (null = auto-detect)
  parallel_cores: null

  # Default timeout in seconds (can be overridden per-test)
  default_timeout: 300

# Executable paths for each software package
# The script will try each path in order until one is found
# You can use:
#   - Just the executable name (will search PATH)
#   - Absolute paths
#   - Environment variables like $HOME or ${TURBODIR}
